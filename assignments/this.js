/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding = binding the content of what this is. It will return the window and its properties and prototypes.
* 2. Implicit Binding = Binding that occurs on whatever is applied to the left of the this keyword
* 3. Explicit Binding = Binding that is for functions. it can help add prototypes and other important bindings to a function
* 4. New Binding = Binding that occurs to a constructor function that allows you to create an instance of that constructor.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
